  abstract =     "The FoxNet is an implementation of the standard
                  TCP/IP networking protocol stack using the Standard
                  ML (SML) language. SML is a type-safe programming
                  language with garbage collection, a unique and
                  advanced module system, and machine-independent
                  semantics. The FoxNet is a user-space implementation
                  of TCP/IP that is built in SML by composing modular
                  protocol elements; each element independently
                  implements one of the standard protocols. One
                  specific combination of these elements implements
                  the standard TCP/IP stack. Other combinations are
                  also possible and can be used to easily and
                  conveniently build custom, non-standard networking
                  stacks. This paper describes in detail the final
                  design and implementation of the FoxNet, including
                  many of the details that are crucially affected by
                  the choice of SML as the programming language.",
